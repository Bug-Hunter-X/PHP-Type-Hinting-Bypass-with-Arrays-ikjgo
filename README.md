This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in PHP related to type hinting.  When a function expects an integer argument, providing an array instead will silently be converted, leading to potentially hard-to-detect errors.  The solution shows how to explicitly check the type using `is_int()` before performing operations to prevent this issue.
